This repo contains 4 files in addition to this readme. 

The script "run_analysis.R" is an annotated code file that contains all the code needed to go from the raw data to the tidy data sets, as well as comments on what is being done in each part of the code. 

CodeBook.md provides an overview of what was done to the data and descriptions of the variables.

The two csv files, "tidy fitness data.csv" and "tidy fitness data by group.csv" provide a tidy dataset of all observations and a tidy dataset where observations are grouped and the mean is provided for each subject.
